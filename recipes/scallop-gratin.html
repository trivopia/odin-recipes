      <h1>Scallop Gratin</h1>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        As far as I'm concerned, a simple gratin is the most delicious way to cook fresh scallops. The only real way to screw this recipe up would be to use the wrong scallops. And by wrong, I mean any scallops that have been soaked in a preservative brine. These are easy to identify, as they're usually sitting in a pool of milky liquid. What you want are usually sold as wild 'day-boat,' 'diver,' or 'dry-pack' scallops. They are really expensive, and worth every penny. Serve with French bread for dipping.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed, melted, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup crème fraîche</li>
        <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>8 dry-pack sea scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Brush 2 small gratin dishes with 1 tablespoon melted butter.</li>
        <li>Whisk crème fraîche, white wine, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, and kosher salt together in a bowl until smooth; add scallops and toss to coat. Let sit until flavors begin to meld, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide scallops between prepared gratin dishes; pour remaining crème fraîche sauce over top. Top with tarragon and Parmesan cheese; drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon butter over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 4 minutes. Increase oven setting to broil; continue cooking until scallops golden brown, slightly springy, and opaque, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>
      </ol>
